Hi! I am Suvendu. My goal is to transfer mathematics from theory to cool applications toward serving society. These services include but are not limited to accessible AI for enhanced cultivation and health care; fast delivery on online purchases; optimized usage of available resources for the best possible outcome. After 5 years of university-level education in mathematics, I landed in the field of data science and AI to make my goal real by exploring methodologies for applying theory in practice. My current work is on the analysis and application of fast randomized methods for a developed version of the current GenAI ( more realistic image generation, efficient logical answering of LLMs, etc).
